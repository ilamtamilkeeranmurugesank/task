         <div>
            <p>Huawei approached us and made it very clear from the start that their new <br /> European headquarters had to be both stylish and unconventional, while still <br /> keeping true to their Asian heritage. Together with the client’s in-house <br /> consultants and our resident architects we were able to complete this project <br /> within the estimated time frame.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The city of Wiesbaden commissioned us to revamp a piece of <br /> commercially available but awkwardly shaped land in downtown <br /> Wiesbaden to a new conference center. The main requirement for <br /> the space was to be modern but flexible so that it could cater to as <br /> many different fields as possible. </p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Our most recent project for Danske Bank was finished months in advance. The <br /> bank wanted to establish their German presence in a nonchalant way, while <br /> injecting a fresh air of Scandinavian design and color to the surrounding <br /> environment. One of the top features of this project remains the intricate main <br /> reception hall, with its glass ceiling. </p>
